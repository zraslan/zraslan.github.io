						<p>I have a passion for creating, collecting, digitizing, georeferencing, and making historical geospatial data available for other to use.</p>
						<p>I love the wild, and I hope one day to work for the nature conservancy.</p>
						<p>I secretly want to learn how to be a traditional cartographer.</p>
						<p>I study History and GIS, specializing in Historical GIS.</p>
						<p>I am terribly afraid of flying.</p>

					<p>When I heard the learn'd astronomer</p>
					<p>When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me</p>
					<p>When I was shown the charts and the diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them</p>
					<p>When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room</p>
					<p>How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick</p>
					<p>Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself</p>
					<p>In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time</p>
					<p>Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.</p>
