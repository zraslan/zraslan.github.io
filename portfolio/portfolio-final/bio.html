			<h3>Hello,</h3>
					
				<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio. The content on this website reflects much of my work experience, education, and interests. However on a personal note, this Bio page may explain some of my motivation and inspiration.</p>

				<p>As a History major, I have studied many diverse histories. Most importantly, I have been trained to study particular material, discern a significant question, gather and analyze sources to ground historical analysis, and to express my analysis in a way that is clear and simple.</p>

				<p>As a Geographic Information Systems minor, I have studied how to analyze geographic data and to use the mapping interface of the software to analyze visual trends and dimensions of the data. Cartography has been a central element of this degree, as map making is part of the analyzing process, and is often part of the final presentation (such as an essay document).<p>

				<p>My true focus has been Historical GIS. I have researched this emerging field quite deeply, eventually deciding to write my Honors Thesis on it. On the other hand, my true passion is being able to help my community. I believe my educational background and work experience have prepared me to offer my skills as a GIS Analyst, Researcher/Analyst, and Cartographer in the hopes of improving our understanding and relationship with the world around us.<p>

				<p>For further description of GIS and how it is currently being applied, these links below were produced by Pennsylvania State University to describe how GIS is utilized to transform and inform the way we interact with the world around us:</p>
